### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there 

# Lucas Silveira

Lover of technology in all forms, but mostly in how people see it in their day to day.
The world needs to be 100% for 100% of people, so everyone has the same access as easily.

In this technological world I decided to focus on the front end, I believe that it is from him that change begins and that conquers people through its use and beauty.  <i>Everything can be easier</i>, nothing needs to be so complex to be used, the front end has a big role to make a world easier.

Since 2013 I've been looking to create tools that make the world <b>simpler</b> and <b>easier</b> for everyone.
